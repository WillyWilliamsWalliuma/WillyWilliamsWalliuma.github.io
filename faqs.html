        <h1>FAQ</h1>
        <p><br><b>What methods of payment do you accept?</b>
          <br><br>
           For example, PayPal and all major credit cards. You could also type something about Gift cards. Maybe you only want to accept Gift cards that are issued by your dropshipping store?
           <br><br><br>
          <b>What if I need to modify my order?</b>
          <br><br> If you would like to add items to your existing order, please place an additional order. We do not store your payment information, so we cannot change the order.
          <br><br><br>
          <b>How do I cancel my order?</b>
          <br><br> You can answer this with “orders cannot be canceled after they are placed”, or you can give your customers a time window of like 24 hours that they can cancel their order.
          <br><br><br>
          <b>Do you provide tracking information? </b>
          <br><br>Yes, we will send you a tracking number via email once your order ships. If you haven’t received tracking info within 5 days, then please contact us.
          <br><br><br>
          <b>I ordered multiple items but only received one.</b>
          <br><br> Where is the rest of my order? We work with multiple global partners, so it can happen that your items are shipped separately; this is to speed up delivery. Don’t worry, you will get the items that you ordered.</p>
